# Easy ORB 0DTE Strategy

**Automated dual-strategy system:** Opening Range Breakout (ORB) for ETFs + selective **0DTE options overlay** for convex amplification — built on **broker-only data**, multi-layer risk controls, and full position monitoring.

> **Positioning:** This repo is part of the "Easy Trading Software" suite — production-grade strategy execution + monitoring designed for reliability, reproducibility, and real-world constraints (rate limits, slippage, missing candles, broker quirks).

### Why this project stands out

- **Broker-only data execution** — No synthetic backtest feeds; production path uses live broker data (e.g. E*TRADE) for ORB capture and execution.
- **Dual-strategy architecture** — ORB core + selective convex overlay (easy0DTE); one capture window, shared validation, separate execution and monitoring.
- **Risk-first design** — Position caps, redistribution logic, regime filters (e.g. red-day), ADV-based slip guard, holiday/low-liquidity avoidance.
- **Deployable cloud service** — Cloud Run–ready with modular collector (easyCollector) for separate data pipelines.

## Evidence (validated baseline)

**Historical validation (11 trading days, October 2024):**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Weekly return** | **+73.69%** |
| **Winning days** | **10/11 (91%)** |
| **Max drawdown** | **-0.84%** (~96% reduction vs baseline) |
| **Profit factor** | **194.00** |
| **Monthly projection (compounded)** | **+508%** |

> Validation results reflect the documented test window and system configuration used at the time. Real-world performance will vary due to fills, spreads, latency, volatility regimes, and broker constraints. **This project is not financial advice.** See [Disclaimer](#disclaimer).

## What it does

This repository contains:

1. **Easy ORB 0DTE Strategy** — Main application (ORB capture → signal collection → execution → monitoring).  
   Deploys as a **single Cloud Run service**.

2. **easy0DTE** — Options overlay module (convex eligibility + execution) used only on the highest-conviction setups.

3. **easyCollector** — Standalone market snapshot collector (ORB / SIGNAL / OUTCOME) for US 0DTE + crypto (separate deploy).

**Core philosophy:**

- ORB captures breakouts from the first 15 minutes of market action.
- 0DTE overlay is selective: **"Gamma > Leverage."**
- Systems-first: guardrails, monitoring, repeatable execution, clean alerts.

---

## What is ORB + 0DTE?

**Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** uses the first minutes of the session (e.g. 15–60 minutes) to define a range (high/low). Breakouts above or below that range are used as trade signals — a well-known pattern in systematic equity and index trading (with variants across 15–60 minute buckets and different confirmation rules).

**0DTE (zero days to expiration)** options expire the same day. They offer high gamma and convexity: small moves in the underlying can produce large percentage moves in the option. They are also highly time-sensitive and can become worthless by expiry, so execution and risk controls are critical.

**This repo** combines both: ORB identifies high-conviction breakouts; the **easy0DTE** overlay applies 0DTE options only to a filtered subset of those signals (convex eligibility, strike selection, position sizing). The result is selective convex amplification with broker-only data and multi-layer risk controls.

## End-to-end flow (one minute)

Typical flow:

**OAuth → Good Morning → ORB Capture → validation candle (7:00/7:15) → Signal Collection → execution → monitoring → EOD**

Key timing (PT):

- **6:30–6:45** ORB capture window  
- **7:00 / 7:15** validation candle + signal collection window  
- **7:30** batch execution  
- **All day** monitoring + exits + reporting

### Architecture sequence

  A[OAuth] --> B[Good Morning]

  C --> D[Validation 7:00/7:15]
  D --> E[Signal Collection]
  E --> F[Execute]
  F --> G[Monitor]
  G --> H[EOD]
```

High-level sequence: **OAuth** → **ORB Capture** (6:30–6:45 PT) → **Validation candle** (7:00/7:15) → **Signal Collection** (ORB + 0DTE filters) → **Execution** (7:30) → **Position monitoring** (trailing, breakeven, exits) → **End-of-day** close and reporting. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/Strategy.md](docs/Strategy.md) for detail.

## Risk controls & guardrails

Designed to reduce failure modes common in automated trading:

- **Risk engine & position sizing** — Caps, redistribution, safety floors, ADV-based slip guard.
- **Market condition / "red day" filtering** — Portfolio-level and signal-level controls to avoid trading in unfavorable regimes.
- **Duplicate prevention & trade persistence** — Idempotent behavior and state stored in GCS.
- **Exit system** — Trailing stops, breakeven logic, time-based and P&L-based exits, with a monitoring loop.
- **Holiday & low-liquidity avoidance** — Config-driven calendar and session checks.

For full detail: [docs/Risk.md](docs/Risk.md) and [docs/Strategy.md](docs/Strategy.md).

## Performance & backtest

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Equity curve** | Full equity curve and drawdown charts are maintained in internal docs and performance packs. |
| **Backtest overview** | Backtest methodology, windows, and assumptions are documented in [docs/Strategy.md](docs/Strategy.md). |
| **Win rate & summary** | Validated baseline metrics are in the [Evidence](#evidence-validated-baseline) section above. |

A full performance pack (tables, charts, sensitivity notes) lives in the production documentation and is not published in this public repo. Use the Evidence table and [docs/Strategy.md](docs/Strategy.md) for reproducibility context.
